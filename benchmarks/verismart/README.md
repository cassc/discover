# Important Notes

- There are two copies of the Verismart benchmarks

  + The copy `verismart-origin` is the original benchmark, downloaded from the
    GitHub repository: https://github.com/kupl/VeriSmart-benchmarks/

  + The copy `verismart-updated` is the version where certain test cases are
    updated by Discover to ensure that compilation and testing with the test
    cases will be successful.
